/*Morganâ€™s Department Store distributes bonuses to its salespeople after the holiday
 rush. Table 9-6 shows the bonuses, which are based on full weeks worked during the
  season and the number of positive online customer reviews. Write a program that
   allows a user to continuously enter values for the number of weeks worked and
    the number of positive reviews received and displays the appropriate bonus until
     the user enter a sentinel value: 99.

     Example output:
     Enter number of full weeks worked or 99 to quit >> 2
     Enter number of positive reviews received >> 3
     Bonus for 2 weeks and 3 positive reviews is 42.0
     Enter number of full weeks worked or 99 to quit >> 99
